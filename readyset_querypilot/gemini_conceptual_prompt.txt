Write a high-performance database load testing script in Go (Golang). The script should simulate a Corporate CRM application called 'CorpCRM' interacting with a MySQL database.

Instead of random queries, structure the workload around three business modules:

Auth: Login and session checks.

Sales: Sales reps checking profiles, salaries, and looking up managers.

HR/Admin: Admins checking department rosters, history, and searching for users.

Requirements:

The script must use Connection Pooling (SetMaxOpenConns) to handle high concurrency efficiently.

It should accept command-line arguments for the total number of requests and the number of concurrent threads.

It must run with zero think-time (immediate execution) to test maximum throughput.

At the end, generate a report showing the Total Duration, Queries Per Second (QPS), and a distribution of which CRM modules were accessed."
