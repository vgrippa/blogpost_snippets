ct as a Senior Go Developer. Write a robust load testing CLI tool in Go targeting a MySQL database.

Configuration:

DB: Host: XXXX, User/Pass: readyset_repl, DB: employees.

Constants: ActiveDate = '9999-01-01', Departments = ['d001'...'d009'].

Architecture:

Use database/sql with the go-sql-driver/mysql driver.

Pooling: In main(), initialize sql.Open once. Set db.SetMaxOpenConns and db.SetMaxIdleConns equal to the user-provided concurrency limit to ensure a persistent pool.

Concurrency: Use a Worker Pool pattern (Goroutines + Channels) to execute requests.

The Workload (10 Specific Functions): Implement these exact SQL patterns inside a CRMAction type:

[Auth] Login: Select name/hire_date by PK.

[Auth] Session: Select dept_no by PK.

[Sales] Profile: Join employees, titles, salaries on emp_no.

[Sales] Salary: Select salary from salaries table.

[Sales] Manager: Select emp_no from dept_manager for a random dept.

[HR] History: Select all titles for a user.

[HR] Roster: Select emp_no from dept_emp (Limit 20).

[HR] New Hires: Select users hired after '1999-10-01' (Limit 10).

[Admin] Search: Select users where first_name = 'Georgi'.

[Sys] Heartbeat: SELECT 1.

Execution:

Accept TotalRequests and Concurrency from os.Args.

Randomly select actions from a weighted list (make Login and Profile occur more frequently).

Output a final performance report including Duration, QPS, and a breakdown of action counts."
