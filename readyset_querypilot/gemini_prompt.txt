Act as an expert Python developer. I need a high-performance, multi-threaded command-line script to perform a stress test on a MySQL database.

Database Configuration:

Host: XXXXX

Port: 3306

User: readyset_repl

Password: XXXX

Database: employees

Core Requirements:

Library: Use mysql-connector-python.

Concurrency: The script must use mysql.connector.pooling for connection management and concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to run requests in parallel.

Arguments: The script must accept two command-line arguments:

Total Requests (int): How many total queries to run.

Concurrency (int): The size of the connection pool and the number of worker threads.

Performance: Do not limit the QPS (Queries Per Second). The script should run as fast as the network/CPU allows (no time.sleep).

Query Logic (OLTP Focus): The goal is to simulate a real-time HR application with fast, indexed lookups.

Avoid Aggregates: Do not use GROUP BY, AVG, or COUNT(*) on large tables. Focus on transactional queries using Primary Keys or Indexes.

Query Types: Implement 8 distinct query functions representing these application actions:

Login Check: Fetch ID/Name by emp_no.

View Profile: Join employees, titles, departments, salaries for a specific emp_no.

Latest Salary: Fetch the most recent salary entry for an emp_no.

Team View: List 10 employees in a specific department.

Job History: Fetch title history for an emp_no.

Manager Lookup: Find the current manager of a random department.

Search by Name: Find employees where last_name starts with a random 3-letter prefix.

Recent Hires: Find employees hired in a specific year range (simple range scan).

Randomization: For every request, a worker thread should randomly select one of these 8 query types. Use a helper to generate valid random emp_no (range 10001 to 300000) to ensure data is found.

Reporting Requirements: At the end of the execution, print a detailed Performance Report containing:

Total Execution Time.

Throughput (QPS): Queries Per Second.

Average Latency: In milliseconds.

Query Distribution: A list showing exactly how many times each of the 8 query types was executed.

Error Analysis: A summary of failed queries and their error messages (if any).
