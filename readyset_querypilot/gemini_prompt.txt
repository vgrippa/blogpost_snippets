Act as a Senior Backend Engineer specializing in Go (Golang) and Performance Testing.

I need a high-performance Load Generator Script written in Go to stress test a MySQL database.

The Concept ("CorpCRM"): Instead of random queries, simulate a CRM system used by 3 different departments. The script should simulate traffic coming from these distinct modules:

Auth Module: Used by everyone (Login, Session Checks).

Sales Module: Used by reps (Viewing Profiles, Checking Commissions/Salaries, Finding Managers).

HR/Admin Module: Used by admins (Department Rosters, History Lookups, New Hire Reports, User Search).

Database Details:

Host: 52.91.141.5

Port: 3306

User/Pass: readyset_repl / readyset_repl

DB Name: employees

Technical Requirements:

Language: Go.

Concurrency: Use Goroutines and Channels. The script must accept Command Line Arguments for <TotalRequests> and <Concurrency>.

Connection Pooling (Crucial): Do not open/close connections per request. Use sql.Open once, and properly configure db.SetMaxOpenConns and db.SetMaxIdleConns to match the concurrency level.

Zero Think-Time: The queries must run immediately one after the other to test maximum throughput (QPS). No time.Sleep.

Data Generators: Use random Employee IDs between 10001 and 40000. Use ActiveDate = '9999-01-01' for current records.

The Queries (Implement these 10):

[Auth] Login: Fetch name/hire_date by PK.

[Auth] Session: Check dept assignment by PK.

[Sales] View Profile: Join Employees + Titles + Salaries (Active).

[Sales] Check Commission: Simple Select on Salary (Active).

[Sales] Find Team Lead: Lookup manager for a random department.

[HR] Title History: Select all titles for a user.

[HR] Dept Roster: Select active employees in a dept (Limit 20).

[HR] New Hires: Range scan for recent hires (Limit 10).

[Admin] Search User: Search by First Name (e.g., 'Georgi').

[Sys] Heartbeat: SELECT 1.

Execution Logic:

Create a weighted list of actions (put Login and Profile twice so they happen more often).

Spawn N workers.

Each worker loops through jobs, picks a random CRM Action, executes it, and records the result string.

Reporting: At the end, print a clean report showing:

Total Duration.

Throughput (QPS).

Success/Error Counts.

A distribution table showing how many times each "CRM Module" action was executed.
