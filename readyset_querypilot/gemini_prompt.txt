Create a single-file Go (Golang) application that simulates a backend CRM (Customer Relationship Management) workload connecting to a MySQL database.

The target database is the standard MySQL 'employees' sample schema.

Key Requirements:

1. Configuration:
   - Include constants for DB credentials (User, Password, Host, Port, Name).
   - Allow configuration for 'Total Requests' and 'Concurrency' (number of goroutines).

2. Architecture:
   - Use the standard `database/sql` and `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` drivers.
   - Implement a robust connection pool (SetMaxOpenConns, SetMaxIdleConns).

3. Workload Simulation (The "Vibe"):
   - Create distinct "Modules" or "Departments" to simulate different user types.
   - HR Module: Run queries involving `employees`, `titles`, and `departments` (e.g., "Find Dept Roster", "View Title History"). Use JOINs.
   - Sales Module: Run queries involving `salaries` and `dept_emp` (e.g., "Check Commission", "Find Team Lead").
   - Auth Module: Simple SELECTs (e.g., "Login", "Validate Session").
   - Admin Module: Complex search queries.

4. Execution Flow:
   - The main function should spawn [Concurrency] worker goroutines.
   - Each worker should randomly select a "Module" and an "Action" to perform.
   - Measure the total execution time.

5. Reporting:
   - At the end, print a clean summary to the console:
     - Total Time
     - Calculated QPS (Throughput)
     - Breakdown of how many times each module/action was called.

Please write the complete, ready-to-run code.
