I have a MySQL 8.0.43 database running on the following connection parameters:
	•	Host: XXXX
	•	Port: 3306
	•	User: readyset_repl
	•	Password: readyset_repl

The database contains the employees sample dataset imported from GitHub.

I want you to generate a Python HR application that simulates typical queries an internal HR system would perform against this database.

Requirements
	1.	The application must be a command-line Python script.
	2.	It must accept a numeric parameter N, where N defines how many simulated requests the application will execute.
	3.	All database connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database name) must be defined at the beginning of the script in a clearly visible configuration section.
	4.	The script should use a standard MySQL connector library for Python (e.g., mysql-connector-python or pymysql), and handle connections and cursors safely (open/close properly, basic error handling).
	5.	For each of the N requests, the application should randomly choose one query type from a pool of at least 20 different query patterns, ranging from simple to complex. These should include, for example:
	•	Simple single-table lookups (e.g., fetch employee by emp_no).
	•	Listing employees in a given department.
	•	Listing departments and their current managers.
	•	Fetching current salary for a given employee.
	•	Fetching full salary history for an employee.
	•	Listing employees hired within a given date range.
	•	Listing employees by job title.
	•	Aggregations (e.g., average salary per department).
	•	Aggregations by title (e.g., max/min/avg salary by title).
	•	Top N highest-paid employees overall.
	•	Top N highest-paid employees per department.
	•	Counting employees per department.
	•	Pagination-style queries (e.g., get a “page” of employees with LIMIT/OFFSET).
	•	Search-like queries (e.g., employees whose last name starts with a given letter).
	•	Multi-join queries combining employees, departments, dept_emp, titles, and salaries.
	•	Subquery-based queries (e.g., employees whose salary is above the average salary of their department).
	•	Queries involving ordering and filtering (e.g., ordered by hire date, or salary descending).
	•	A query that finds employees who changed titles at least once.
	•	A query that finds departments with no current manager (if any).
	•	Any additional realistic HR-related queries to reach at least 20 distinct query types.
	6.	The script must be structured so that each query type is implemented as a separate function or clearly separated block, and there is a central dispatcher that picks one at random for each request.
	7.	For each request, the script should:
	•	Execute the chosen query.
	•	Print a short description of the query type being run.
	•	Print a small, readable subset of the results to the console (not the entire table).
	8.	The script should be easy to modify so that I can later adjust or add new query types.
